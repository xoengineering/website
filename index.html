    <h3>Small</h3>

    <p>
      Like actually small.
      Not just small by modern American standard because the Overton window of truck sizes and migrated so big that people actually call a Ford F150 a small truck.
      <i>:I can‚Äôt roll my eyes out of my head hard enough:</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      Small like original VW Beetle, Smart Car, Mini Cooper small.
    </p>

    <h3>Quiet</h3>

    <p>
      It‚Äôs absurd to me that we live in a society that thinks loud cars and trucks are cool.
      Nothing else in our lives do we value loudness in a thing.
      Except for things whose purpose is to make noise: stereos, guitar amps, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everything else, we value quietness.
      Dishwasher, laundry, vacuum, TV, power tools, garage door opener, doors just regular doors‚Ä¶
      if anything can make less sound, we rightfully believe that that quietness make the thing a better version of itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      But with cars and trucks, some people think that <i>loud is cool</i>.
      I am not those people.
    </p>

    <h3>Electric</h3>

    <p>
      EV is the very near future.
      In many ways, it‚Äôs already the present.
      I‚Äôve been driving a 2019 Volkswagen eGolf for a year.
      I never want to own a gas internal combustion (IC) vehicle again.
      IC vehicle are messy, loud, fluid-y for the driver and owner.
      They‚Äôve got range, obviously.
      But at what cost, friend?
      At what cost!?
    </p>

    <h3>Cute</h3>

    <p>
      Have you seen trucks in the past couple decades?
      Yuck.
      Gimme a Volkswagen Vanagon, a Volvo 240 wagon, a Porsche 911.
      Something that when people look at it, they think ‚Äú<q>that‚Äôs cute</q>‚Äù, not ‚Äú<q>fragile masculinity</q>‚Äù.
      More <i>beep beep</i>, less <i>vroom vroom</i> rolling coal.
